아래에는 여러분이 선택할 수 있는 진로와, 프론트엔드, 백엔드 또는 데브옵스가 되기 위해 채택할 기술들을 나타내는 차트들이 있습니다. 저는 무언가 공유하면서 대학 학부생들에게 통찰력을 주고싶어 하셨던 제 노교수님을 위해 본 차트를 작성했습니다. 이렇게 커뮤니티를 돕기 위해 이곳에 공유하면서 말이죠

<h3 align="center"><strong>Purpose of these Roadmaps</strong></h3>

> The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and trendy never means best suited for the job.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Note to Beginners</strong></h3>

> These roadmaps cover everything that is there to learn for the paths listed below. Don't feel overwhelmed, you don't need to learn it all in the beginning if you are just getting started. We are working on the beginner versions of these and will [release it soon](https://roadmap.sh) after we are done with the 2020 release of the Backend and DevOps roadmaps.

If you think that these can be improved in any way, please do suggest.
